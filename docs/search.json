These assignments include the first Cornell Notes assignment, the math assessment, and all the Growth Mindset assignments. The reason for these hard deadlines is due to the nature of the assignments – for example, it is not helpful for you to take the math assessment and discover in the last week of class that you really should review trig. For all other assignments, if you need an extension, you may request one using this form. We recognize that things come up and you may require some flexibility at some point in the semester. Please feel free to reach out to your instructor if you are struggling to meet a deadline. We want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class!"

Each assignment within a bundle is equally weighted, and individual assignments will all be graded with a rubric that includes the learning objectives, so that you can see very clearly what you missed.\nGrades will be determined from percentages using the following table:\n\nLetter grades\n\n\nLetter grade\nPercent range\n\n\n\n\nA\n92.5 ≤ x ≤ 100\n\n\nA-\n90 ≤ x &lt; 92.5\n\n\nB+\n87.5 ≤ x &lt; 90\n\n\nB\n82.5 ≤ x &lt; 87.5\n\n\nB-\n80 ≤ x &lt; 82.5\n\n\nC+\n77.5 ≤ x &lt; 80\n\n\nC\n72.5 ≤ x &lt; 77.5\n\n\nC-\n70 ≤ x &lt; 72.5\n\n\nD+\n67.5 ≤ x &lt; 70\n\n\nD\n62.5 ≤ x &lt; 67.5\n\n\nD-\n60 ≤ x &lt; 62.5\n\n\nF\n0 ≤ x &lt; 60\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Mindset (15%)Practice (30%)Lab Reports (20%)Jigsaw Solve/Teach Activities (20%)The Problem Project (15%)\n\n\nAn important element of being a scientist is seeing opportunities to improve from mistakes and failures. This is emphasized in this class in multiple ways, through homework and test re-dos as well as through this growth mindset assignment, which spans the entire semester. This assign- ment cannot be redone, and some of the deadlines are fixed in order to make it a useful activity.\n\nCourse pre-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nCourse post-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nMath Assessment (with two chances to re-take)\nGrowth Mindset Reflection\nSMART goal setting\nSMART goal mid-semester check-in\nSMART goal final reflection\n\nGiven the purpose of these activities, we will not offer extensions beyond one week on the deadlines for the Growth Mindset bundle, except in case of a major medical or family emergency.\n\n\n\nWeekly Cornell Notes\n\nThis will include one initial assignment to demonstrate how to do Cornell Notes\nTo learn more about Cornell Notes, there is a detailed walkthrough in the FAQ\nYou can drop 2 Cornell Notes assignments with no penalty\n\nWeekly Problems\n\nThe first question on the weekly problem set is a reflection on the previous problem set\nYou can drop 2 Weekly Problem assignments with no penalty\n\n\n\n\nThere will be three lab reports during the semester. These reports are more than just a short write-up of what you did. These are an exercise in synthesizing the concepts you learned in class with the activities you did in the laboratory. The lab write-ups must include a short introductory paragraph putting into context the activity, a clear statement of the question you were trying to answer with the activity, an explanation of the methods you used (what did you measure, how did you do it, how did you account for error, etc), a visualization of your results (using plots and figures), and a discussion of what your results mean. We don’t ever expect you to have perfect data, so this discussion is an opportunity to explain the problems that arose and what you might have done differently if you’d had more time.\n\nThere will be three labs you can write up\nYou only need to write up two of them\nYou may revise each lab report once\n\nNote: Lab activities will be integrated into many classes, and sometimes the data you collect in these activities will be used in your weekly homework assignment for that week or for a lab report. Completing the labs is an important part of your learning in the course, so you may not use another student’s data for your homework problem or lab report. If you are unable to attend a class you may contact the instructor (in advance if possible) about finding a time to make up the lab work.\n\n\nThere will be three jigsaw activities during the semester. In these activities, you will be given a challenging problem to solve in small groups. Together your group must write up a “lesson plan” that demonstrates how to approach and solve that problem. In the next class period, you will be split into different groups in which each member of the group solved a different problem, and you will have to teach your problem to that group. To get credit for these jigsaws, you must participate in both days of activity and submit your write-up for the question you were assigned and a second write-up for one of the problems you learned on the second day."
