For all other assignments, if you need an extension, you may request one using this form. We recognize that things come up and you may require some flexibility at some point in the semester.

This is emphasized in this class in multiple ways, through homework and test re-dos as well as through the goal-setting assignment, which spans the entire semester. Please note that some of the deadlines are more rigid in this bundle in order to make it a useful activity.\n\nCourse pre-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nCourse post-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nMath Assessment (with two chances to re-take)\nGrowth Mindset Reflection\nSMART goal setting\nSMART goal mid-semester check-in\nSMART goal final reflection\n\nGiven the purpose of these activities, we will not offer extensions beyond one week on the deadlines for the Growth Mindset bundle, except in case of a major medical or family emergency.\n\n\nGood note-taking and regular problem-solving are very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have to turn in your Cornell Notes for the class and a short weekly problem set. More details below:\n\nWeekly Cornell Notes\n\nThis will include one initial assignment to demonstrate how to do Cornell Notes\nTo learn more about Cornell Notes, there is a detailed walkthrough in the FAQ\n\nWeekly Problem Sets\n\nThe first question on the weekly problem set is a reflection on the previous problem set\n\n\nYou can drop any 4 items in the “Practice” bundle with no penalty\n\n\nLab activities will be integrated into many classes, and completing the labs is an important part of your learning in the course, so you may not use another student’s data for your homework problem or lab report. If you are unable to attend a class you may contact the instructor (in advance if possible) about finding a time to make up the lab work.\nThere will be three labs you can write a report on during the semester, but you only need to do two of them. These reports are more than just a short write-up of what you did. These are an exercise in synthesizing the concepts you learned in class with the activities you did in the laboratory.\nThe lab reports must include:\n\na short introductory paragraph putting into context the activity\na clear statement of the question you were trying to answer with the activity\nan explanation of the methods you used (what did you measure, how did you do it, how did you account for error, etc)\na visualization of your results (using plots and figures)\na discussion of what your results mean.\n\nNote: We don’t ever expect you to have perfect data, so use the discussion as an opportunity to explain the problems that arose and what you might have done differently if you’d had more time.\nYou may revise and resubmit each lab report one time.\n\n\nThere will be two jigsaw activities during the semester. In these activities, you will be given a challenging problem to solve in small groups. Together your group must write up a “lesson plan” that demonstrates how to approach and solve that problem. In the next class period, you will be split into different groups in which each member of the group solved a different problem, and you will have to teach your problem to that group.\nTo get credit for these jigsaws, you must:\n\nparticipate in both days of activity\nsubmit your “lesson plan” write-up for the question you were assigned\nsubmit a second write-up for one of the problems you learned on the second day\n\nYou may revise and resubmit each jigsaw write-up one time.\n\n\nThe student becomes the teacher… your final project for this class is to write a physics problem similar to the jigsaw problems. You must:\n\nselect at least one key idea from three of the five different groups\nwrite a physics problem that tests understanding those three key ideas\nwrite up a detailed solution to that problem using the four-step problem solving method\nexplain how your problem tests understanding for the three key ideas you selected\n\nBecause this is due during finals week, there will not be an opportunity to revise and resubmit this"
