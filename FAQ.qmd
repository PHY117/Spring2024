## When is \_\_ due? {#duedates}

You can find all due dates on the [course schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NN6zv30J_MdUYzjDmjOMn1q-IKhxN0H8w9O3rMQsQ1A/edit?usp=sharing). Dates are subject to change, but will always be kept up to date on the schedule so check back if you're not sure.

## Can I have an extension? {#extensionpolicy}

Some assignments will have hard deadlines. These assignments include the first Cornell Notes assignment, the math assessment, and all the Growth Mindset assignments. The reason for these hard deadlines is due to the nature of the assignments -- for example, it is not helpful for you to take the math assessment and discover in the last week of class that you really should review trig. For all other assignments, if you need an extension, you may request one using [this form](https://forms.gle/qTLy66bkUNZ5ibTj7). We recognize that things come up and you may require some flexibility at some point in the semester. Please feel free to reach out to your instructor if you are struggling to meet a deadline. We want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class!

## Can I revise and resubmit something I did poorly on? {#revisionpolicy}

For most assignments, yes. Some assignments cannot be revised or retaken because of the nature of the assignment or when it is due. More information for each assignment can be found on this [template grade sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43gE7XIsHia5bAcqoeek3scpJ-EyI1tOqB7SRFVZX0/edit?usp=sharing).

## When will you reply to my email? {#emails}

Timely communication is really important, but in order to be effective instructors, we also need to be able to take breaks from email. Here are the expectations you can have of us with respect to email response time:

# Casey

If you email me on a weekday, you can expect a response from me within 24 hours. If you email me on a weekend, you can expect a response from me by class time on Monday (or the first day back if it's a long weekend or holiday).

## Do you grade on a curve? {#gradingcurve}

Grades are not curved; your grade depends only on your own performance, supporting your fellow students will help every one of you.

Your grades can be calculated using our [template grading sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43gE7XIsHia5bAcqoeek3scpJ-EyI1tOqB7SRFVZX0/edit?usp=sharing), and letter grades are determined from percentages using [this chart](#lettergrades)

## What the heck are Cornell Notes?? {#cornellnotes}

## What should I do if I get behind on my work? {#catchingup}

```{=html}
<!--## Why do the percentages in the grading bundles add up to more than 100? {#morethan100percent}

Our goal in this class is to help you learn, and there is more than one way to develop a deep understanding of a topic. We want you to be outside your comfort zone, but not so stressed by deadlines and grades that you can't explore these topics.

To get an A in this class, you need a 92.5%, and you can earn up to 115%. This gives you flexibility to choose your own PHY 117 adventure:
-   If you have a note-taking strategy that you love and you really don't want to do Cornell notes, you can still get an A.
-   If you really struggle with teaching a problem to your classmates, you don't have to ace that activity to get an A.
-   If you do great work all semester and have a high enough grade going into the last few weeks of the semester, you can skip the final project entirely.
So think about what will allow you to focus on learning and step outside your comfort zone in this class, and Casey and Manbir are both happy to help you with this!-->
