## Where do I get my textbook?

First: **do not buy a copy of the book** -- it's available to borrow for the entire semester from Nielsen Library. Please ask for "Physics for Scientists and Engineers" or just "the textbook for PHY 117" at the front desk.

If you decide you love this textbook so much that you would like to buy a copy for yourself to keep forever, of course feel free to do so. The book is the [second edition of Knight's "Physics for Scientists and Engineers."](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Scientists-Engineers-Strategic-Approach/dp/0805327363).

## Where do I find assignment instructions/course handouts/slides? {#findstuff}

We created this website to make the syllabus and basic questions about the course easy, but not everything will be here. Handouts, in-class activities, specific assignments, and class slides and/or recordings will all be in the course Moodle. Links to schedule meetings with your instructors will also be in Moodle, due to privacy considerations (this website is open to the public).

If you are enrolled in the class but do not have access to Moodle, please let us know immediately so we can add you.

## When is \_\_ due? {#duedates}

You can find all due dates on the [course schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NN6zv30J_MdUYzjDmjOMn1q-IKhxN0H8w9O3rMQsQ1A/edit?usp=sharing). Dates are subject to change, but will always be kept up to date on the schedule so check back if you're not sure.

## Can I have an extension? {#extensionpolicy}

In general, we are happy to work with you on deadlines, but it's important for you to communicate with us. You can request extensions using [this form](https://forms.gle/qTLy66bkUNZ5ibTj7). Please note that the 48 hour extension is automatically granted, while anything longer than that requires that we have a conversation. That conversation starts by you proposing a new deadline in the form, and then your instructor can talk to you about what's possible or reasonable given the course schedule, your circumstances, and other factors that may vary as the semester progresses.

For more on our deadlines and extension policy, see the [syllabus](syllabus.qmd#deadlines).

## Can I revise and resubmit something I did poorly on? {#revisionpolicy}

For most assignments, yes. Some assignments cannot be revised or retaken because of the nature of the assignment or when it is due. More information for each assignment can be found on this [template grade sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43gE7XIsHia5bAcqoeek3scpJ-EyI1tOqB7SRFVZX0/edit?usp=sharing).

## When will you reply to my email? {#emails}

Timely communication is really important, but in order to be effective instructors, we also need to be able to take breaks from email. Here are the expectations you can have of us with respect to email response time:

::: panel-tabset
### Casey

If you email me on a weekday, you can expect a response from me within 24 hours. If you email me on a weekend, you can expect a response from me by class time on Monday (or the first day back if it's a long weekend or holiday).

## Do you grade on a curve? {#gradingcurve}

Grades are not curved; your grade depends only on your own performance, supporting your fellow students will help every one of you.

Your grades can be calculated using our [template grading sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o43gE7XIsHia5bAcqoeek3scpJ-EyI1tOqB7SRFVZX0/edit?usp=sharing), and letter grades are determined from percentages using [this chart](syllabus.qmd#lettergrades)

## What the heck are Cornell Notes?? {#cornellnotes}

Cornell Notes are a method of structuring your note-taking to improve comprehension and retention. You can read more about Cornell Notes [here](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/).

The goal of Cornell Notes is not just good in-class note-taking, but developing a short but effective regular review process. To do this, you divide your page into four blocks, as shown below.

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
![](graphics/CornellNotes0.png){fig-alt="A lined page divided into 4 rectangles: a long horizontal header at the top, a long horizontal footer at the bottom, and the middle section divided into one tall and narrow sidebar and a larger space to the right" fig-align="left" width=100%}

:::
:::{.g-col-8}

Each of these four spaces has a purpose:

-   The header is where you write the topic: in just a few words, what is this lesson about?
-   The largest section is for taking notes during class, just as you'd always take notes
-   The sidebar on the left is where you write cues or questions about the content
-   The footer is where you write a brief (one-sentence) summary of the page's content

:::

:::
The process for doing this can be divided into three steps:

::: panel-tabset
### During class

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
![](graphics/CornellNotes1.png){fig-alt="The same lined page, but the header is highlighted and says 'topic' and the largest rectangle is highlighted and says 'notes from class'" fig-align="left" width=100%}
:::


::: {.g-col-8}
During class, you fill out the topic and take notes in the largest space, as shown here. You don't have to worry about structuring these notes in any way. Write whatever you would usually write, include sketches and equations and diagrams, etc. You will reflect on these notes later in the remaining spaces, and it's those spaces that will help make your notes more useful.
:::
:::
### Later that day

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
![](graphics/CornellNotes2.png){fig-alt="The same lined page, but now the sidebar on the left is highlighted and says 'questions and key words'" fig-align="left" width=100%}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}
After class, preferably on the same day, but the next day is okay, you read over your notes and as you go, jot down some questions and key words in the sidebar. These will help you when you're studying -- consider them prompts whose answers appear in the notes to the right.

This is the "Recall Column" -- it's where you leave a short note that helps you recall the content of the notes.

::: 

:::

### Later that week

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}

![](graphics/CornellNotes3.png){fig-alt="The same lined page, but now the footer on the bottom is highlighted and says 'summary'" fig-align="left" width=100%}

:::

::: {.g-col-8}
At the end of the week of lectures, skim your notes one more time (those key words should help make this fast!) and at the bottom of each page, jot down a one sentence summary of what the most important concepts on that page are.

This is something you can do when working on the weekly homework problem -- as you look through your notes to help determine how to solve the problem, add these summaries at the end of each page.

## Can I use ChatGPT in this class? {#ChatGPT}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely here to stay. Banning them from the classroom is both pointless and actively unhelpful. If you are going to use ChatGPT or a similar LLM in this class, we only require two things:

1.    That you do a little reading on Large Language Models. Specifically, read [this article about how LLMs actually work](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/03/do-large-language-models-know-what-they-are-talking-about/) and [this article about the ethical considerations around LLMs](https://montrealethics.ai/what-lies-behind-agi-ethical-concerns-related-to-llms/)

2.    That you consider ChatGPT a source that you must cite. If you use ChatGPT or another LLM to help with any assignment, you must acknowledge that help and give a short (one-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.

Remember that LLMs are designed to predict the most likely response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to "hallucinating" (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can't do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are teaching in this class.


## What should I do if I get behind on my work? {#catchingup}

First, reach out to your instructor. It helps us to know that you are working on catching up. We are also happy to meet and help you set adjusted deadlines to get back on track.

Second, if you are feeling really overwhelmed, consider scheduling an appointment with [Duncan Griffin](https://go.oncehub.com/LearningSpecialistDuncanGriffin) at the Jacobson Center. His role is to support students seeking help with time management, organization, reading, test-taking, note-taking, and other academic skills. He can help you talk through what strategies work for you, what strategies don't, and how to manage your time and energy in a more sustainable way.

## I have accommodations from ODS. What should I do? {#ODS}

We have tried to bring the concept of [universal design](https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-universal-design-0) into how we have planned and structured this course, so we hope that any accommodations you have from ODS are already built into this course. However, we don't expect to have done this perfectly (as there is no such thing), so if you have need of certain accommodations that are not already provided by this class, please let us know and we will do our best to meet those needs.

## What if I need more support in this class? {#extrahelp}
We have a few options to help you if you feel you would benefit from additional practice, instruction, or general physics and math suppport. 

-   The Spinelli Center offers [tutoring](https://www.smith.edu/academics/applied-learning-research/spinelli-center-quantitative-learning/tutoring) , including PHY 117 specific tutors. Check out their website to find the tutor hours and request additional support.

-   The Spinelli Center also often does math workshops and review sessions. You can see their offerings [here](https://www.smith.edu/academics/applied-learning-research/spinelli-center-quantitative-learning/workshops-review)

- The Physics department has constructed a special course to be taken alongside PHY 117, called [PHY 115: Quantitative Approaches to Physics](syllabus.qmd#phy115). This is a 1-credit course that you can take to get more practice connecting the math to the physics concepts.

<!--## Why do the percentages in the grading bundles add up to more than 100? {#morethan100percent}

Our goal in this class is to help you learn, and there is more than one way to develop a deep understanding of a topic. We want you to be outside your comfort zone, but not so stressed by deadlines and grades that you can't explore these topics.

![ZPD](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Zone_of_proximal_development.svg/1280px-Zone_of_proximal_development.svg.png)
Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development)

To get an A in this class, you need a 92.5%, and you can earn up to 115%. This gives you flexibility to choose your own PHY 117 adventure:
-   If you have a note-taking strategy that you love and you really don't want to do Cornell notes, you can still get an A.
-   If you really struggle with teaching a problem to your classmates, you don't have to ace that activity to get an A.
-   If you do great work all semester and have a high enough grade going into the last few weeks of the semester, you can skip the final project entirely.
So think about what will allow you to focus on learning and step outside your comfort zone in this class, and Casey and Manbir are both happy to help you with this!-->
